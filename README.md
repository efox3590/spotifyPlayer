    /*
        UI TASKS
    */

    // keypress event for the input field
    // click event for your search button
    // both should call the *same* function
    // that runs SpotifyAPI.search
    // the results are then added to a div or something
    // that lives below your input fields

    // OPTIONAL: you can build your UI task functions in the same
    // way we built the PlaylistManager and SpotifyAPI tasks
